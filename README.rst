**StraWBerryPy** (Single-poinT and local invaRiAnts for Wannier Berriologies in Python) is a Python package to calculate topological invariants and quantum-geometrical quantities in non-crystalline topological insulators.

The code reads tight-binding models from `PythTB <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/>`_, `TBmodels <https://tbmodels.greschd.ch/en/latest/>`_ and `Wannier90 <https://wannier.org/>`_ (through `WannierBerri <https://wannier-berri.org/index.html>`_). 

StraWBerryPy can work both with periodic (PBCs) and open (OBCs) boundary conditions. The code allows to create and manipulate supercells and finite models, for example adding disorder. Single-point and local topological markers can be computed, in addition to other quantum-geometrical quantities (e.g., the localization marker).
